## 10/20/2025 6 PM - Initial research  

Ive done some research and sadly i will not be able to have the stick act as a display due to the usb graphics controllers not being available to hobbyists. I will still be able to have it act as a mass media device and some other stuff though. I have decided on the rp2040 for its native usb support.

## 10/20/2025 10 PM - began working on schematic  

Im very new to pcb/circuit design, but ive started working on the schematic for the board. Right now i only have the usb c plug, a voltage regulator for the microcontroller, and a diode array IC for ESD protection.

## 10/21/2025 - Finished basic schematic for RP2040  

![blueprint-2.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDE4MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--eae81e628c7b982c59453b910466f11718cffbc2/blueprint-2.png)

Ive now finished the circuit for getting the RP2040 up and running. I have the following components laid out right now:
- The rp2040 (ofc)
- A crystal oscillator for the clock
- A 16mb flash chip
- The usb c connector
- A diode array ic for esd protection on the usb c connector
- A 3.3v voltage regulator as to not magic smoke the rp2040
- Reset and boot buttons
- Debug connector
- and a bunch of passives

Next up is actually making it do something!

P.S, if you're making something with an RP2040, check out [Hardware design with RP2040](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/hardware-design-with-rp2040.pdf) and the datasheets, they are both great resources!  

## 10/31/2025 12:06 AM - Picking the right radio chip  

One of the major features of this badusb that sets it apart is the integrated lora radio. I initially wanted to use the SX1262 chip directly as its pretty new and has a good power efficiency. It wouldn't be *that* hard to use the chip directly, but RF is pretty much black magic to me and making sure i don't get a bunch of interference to the rp2040 that's right next to it is not something i would be able to pull of with my current skills.

The other route is to use an off-the-shelf module that does all the hard RF design for you. These modules also have a nice little metal faraday cage thingy to minimize interference further.

While SX1262 modules exists, i have pretty tight dimensions constraints and i couldn't find any that would fit, so i decided to go with an SX1278 module instead which are more common. Specifically the Ai-Thinker RA-02 (not sure how a lora module has even remotely anything to do with ai), which i have used in projects before  

## 10/31/2025 12:36 AM - Schematic done (almost)  

Added the dip switch, radio chip, the pull out sensor and a neopixel. Theres not much else but i remember needing another button i just forgot what i would need it for.
