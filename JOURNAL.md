## 10/20/2025 - Initial research  

Ive done some research and sadly i will not be able to have the stick act as a display due to the usb graphics controllers not being available to hobbyists. I will still be able to have it act as a mass media device and some other stuff though. I have decided on the rp2040 for its native usb support.
