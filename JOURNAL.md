## 10/20/2025 6 PM - Initial research  

Ive done some research and sadly i will not be able to have the stick act as a display due to the usb graphics controllers not being available to hobbyists. I will still be able to have it act as a mass media device and some other stuff though. I have decided on the rp2040 for its native usb support.

## 10/20/2025 10 PM - began working on schematic  

Im very new to pcb/circuit design, but ive started working on the schematic for the board. Right now i only have the usb c plug, a voltage regulator for the microcontroller, and a diode array IC for ESD protection.

## 10/21/2025 - Finished basic schematic for RP2040

Ive now finished the circuit for getting the RP2040 up and running. I have the following components laid out right now:
- The rp2040 (ofc)
- A crystal oscillator for the clock
- A 16mb flash chip
- The usb c connector
- A diode array ic for esd protection on the usb c connector
- A 3.3v voltage regulator as to not magic smoke the rp2040
- Reset and boot buttons
- Debug connector
- and a bunch of passives

Next up is actually making it do something!

P.S, if you're making something with an RP2040, check out [Hardware design with RP2040](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/hardware-design-with-rp2040.pdf) and the datasheets, they are both great resources!
