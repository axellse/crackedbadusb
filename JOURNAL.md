## 10/20/2025 6 PM - Initial research  

Ive done some research and sadly i will not be able to have the stick act as a display due to the usb graphics controllers not being available to hobbyists. I will still be able to have it act as a mass media device and some other stuff though. I have decided on the rp2040 for its native usb support.

## 10/20/2025 10 PM - began working on schematic  

Im very new to pcb/circuit design, but ive started working on the schematic for the board. Right now i only have the usb c plug, a voltage regulator for the microcontroller, and a diode array IC for ESD protection.
